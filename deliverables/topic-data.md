# Identify the Topic and Datasets
* Create a file called `topic-application.md` from the [template](../templates/topic-application.md) and place it in the `deliverables` directory.
* Amongst group members, identify a 1-3 broad topics to create a knowledge graph. 
  * In previous installations of this course, there has been a KG about [scene descriptions](https://github.com/CJMenart/MetadataRepresentationProject), [airplanes](https://github.com/cs7810-group3/group3Project), and [asteroid mining](https://github.com/meganthehorse/CS7810).
* Assess the identified broad topics for:
  * Merit: is the topic intellectually challenging?
  * Novelty: is there already a knowledge graph for this topic?
  * Timeliness: does creating a knowledge graph for this topic address a current event or important (unsolved) problem?
  * Audience: broadly, who would be interestd in a knowledge graph for this topic?
* For each topic, identify 5-10 datasets or existing resources that can be used to populate a knowledge graph.

**Note:** Ensure that each member contributes in explicit commits. Do not squash commits; the `git` history will serve as a record of participation and contribution.
