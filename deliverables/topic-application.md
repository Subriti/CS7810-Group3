# Topic 1: AI Research Knowledge Graph

**Merit:** is the topic intellectually challenging?

The topic is highly intellectually challenging, as it requires integrating heterogeneous data sources (DBLP, arXiv, NSF, USPTO) into a unified semantic structure. It involves ontology design, entity resolution, semantic integration, and graph queryingâ€”all of which are non-trivial technical tasks in AI and knowledge engineering.

**Novelty:** is there already a knowledge graph for this topic?

Currently, there are isolated efforts (e.g., OpenAlex, Microsoft Academic Graph before deprecation, Dimensions). However, there is no comprehensive, domain-specific knowledge graph tailored specifically for **AI research trends**, linking **publications, patents, grants, and institutions** in one unified schema. This provides a novel angle compared to general bibliometric KGs.

**Timeliness:** does creating a knowledge graph for this topic address a current event or important (unsolved) problem?

AI research is expanding at an unprecedented pace, with massive growth in areas like Large Language Models, multimodal AI, and generative AI. Policymakers, funding agencies, and researchers need timely insights into evolving trends, collaborations, and funding landscapes. A domain-specific AI Research Knowledge Graph directly addresses this urgent need for transparency and analysis in a fast-moving field.

**Audience:** broadly, who would be interestd in a knowledge graph for this topic?

* **Researchers**: to identify collaboration networks, trends, and influential works.
* **Funding agencies (NSF, DARPA, EU Horizon)**: to analyze impact and optimize funding strategies.
* **Industry labs (Google, OpenAI, DeepMind, Microsoft, Meta)**: to track academic-industry collaboration and patent landscapes.
* **Policy makers and science strategists**: to understand global AI research directions and allocate resources effectively.
* **Students and educators**: to explore emerging AI subfields and research frontiers.
